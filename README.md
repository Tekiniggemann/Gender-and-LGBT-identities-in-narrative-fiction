# Gender-and-LGBT-identities-in-narrative-fiction
An analysis based on reading data from the goodreads website, as a Midbootcamp project of Ironhack Data Analytics Full Time Bootcamp.


# Project description:
for this project I try to look at the represence and rating of feminism, gender topics and sexual orientation diversity in fictional literature.
To do this, I used the data provided by Lorena Casanova Lozano and Sergio Costa Planells in this repository: https://github.com/joluhergo/goodreads_bbe_dataset/tree/main/Docs_%26_Examples

Used tools for this project: Jupyter Notebook, MySQL to clean, explore and prepare the data / public Tableau to to visually explore the results

This analysis is only an attempt to explore a subject on which an approach using only these tools is not possible. However, I believe it can be of great use in exploring the problem.

# My Motivation

Literature plays a fundamental role in our lives. One of the ways we construct our identity is through narratives. We need fiction because it is only by exposing ourselves to narratives that we shape our own narrative and our personal identity. I think we need the validation that comes from the narratives in which we find the characters that are our references.

That is why I have chosen to carry out an analysis in which we can study the presence of the avobe-mentioned topics. My intention is not only to see the representation, but also the popularity, to see if goodreads users really consume different types of fiction (despite of how they identify themselves).

# Challenges

I believe that much of the data was not relevant to the analysis. Deciding what was relevant took time.

As almost all of the data were categorical and qualitative variables, and due to the great difficulty of categorising and simplifying something as diverse and complex as the literature, the main effort was to find categories that were optimal for the analysis: generalising a lot and trying not to lose too much information.

# How to use
You can download the dataset from the owners' repository, provided above, or in the documents used in this repository.
To view or modify the data in .ipynb files you will need an environment capable of running Jupyter Notebooks.
To interactively explore the data, you can use the following link to Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jose.luis.hern.ndez.gonz.lez/viz/project_goodreads/Dashboard1) You can download and modify it in the Tableau Public desktop application.
